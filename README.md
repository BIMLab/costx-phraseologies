CostX Phraseology Librarty
==========================

Open developments for CostX from Exactal (www.exactal.com.au).

This project is a shared development of phraseology library for CostX users in Sri Lanka using the
local Standard of Measurement for building works SLS573. We intend to extend this to international
standards such as SMM7 and CESMM.

This is our first project, and we are still learning how to use Github.
